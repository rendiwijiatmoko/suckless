# Rendi's build of st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (st is installed into
the `/usr/local` namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
```bash
$ sudo make clean install
```
